# Security-by-Design in IoT Framework (SbD-IoT-Framework)

## Overview
This repository hosts the development, simulation, and analysis of the **Security-by-Design (SbD) Framework for IoT Networks**. The goal of this project is to integrate security measures into every phase of the IoT System Development Lifecycle (SDLC) to create resilient, scalable, and secure IoT ecosystems.

The repository includes:
- Implementation of the Security-by-Design framework.
- Threat modeling and risk analysis tools.
- Sample programs for TPM attestation, secure communication, intrusion detection, and more.
- Simulation scripts and results for testing the proposed framework.

## How to Use
This repository is currently under development and private. Detailed instructions for usage will be added once the repository is complete.

### Planned Usage Instructions:
1. **Installation**:  
   Set up the environment with the required dependencies and libraries (e.g., `cryptography`, `paho-mqtt`, `psutil`).

2. **Running Sample Programs**:  
   Navigate to the `/code/` directory and run specific scripts:
   ```bash
   python3 code/intrusion_detection.py
3. Simulations:
   The /scripts/ directory will contain automation scripts for running end-to-end simulations. Stay tuned for details.

4. Configuration:
   Modify configuration files in /configs/ to tailor the simulations to your IoT setup.


Work in Progress
To-Do List:
